## Introducing GiveCup

GiveCup is a gamified Web3 based mobile app revolutionizing charitable donations. Developed by a trio of high school students & Web3 enthusiasts, GiveCup aims to ensure every donation counts, while providing a rewarding and engaging user experience.

GiveCup revolutionizes the way charitable donations are made, by integrating the benefits of the blockchain, gamification, and community-building. We make donations secure, transparent, and rewarding, striving to create a personal connection between the donor and the organization.
